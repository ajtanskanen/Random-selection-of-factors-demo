# Random-selection-of-factors-demo
This repository contains a demonstration of issues presented in our PLOS article Random selection of factors preserves the correlation structure in a linear factor model to a high degree. In more detail, here we present an R code, courtesy of the anynymous reviewer, that demonstrates that $d$-dimensional random vectors from distribution $N(0,1/\sqrt{d})$ have unit length on average, and that their covariance is close to zero.
