In the main article, we consider random vectors in $R^d$ whose components are taken independently from a common distribution with a zero mean and a variance $1/d$. Here we present an R code, courtesy of the anynymous reviewer, that demonstrates that $d$-dimensional random vectors from distribution $N(0,1/\sqrt{d})$ have unit length on average, and that their covariance is close to zero.

```{r}
d <- 3
N <- 100000
meandistsq1 <- 0
meandistsq2 <- 0
cov <- 0

for (i in 1:N)
{
  r1 <- rnorm(d, mean=0, sd=1/sqrt(d))
  r2 <- rnorm(d, mean=0, sd=1/sqrt(d))
  distsq1 <- sum(r1^2)
  meandistsq1 <- meandistsq1 + distsq1/N
  distsq2 <- sum(r2^2)
  meandistsq2 <- meandistsq2 + distsq2/N
  cov <- cov + sum(r1*r2)/N
}

meandistsq1
meandistsq2
cov
```


To check that both values are reached with a high probability needs some assumptions about the tail behavior of the common distribution. More details about such estimates can be found in the Supporting Information S1.
